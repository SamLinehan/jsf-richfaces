# JSF with RichFaces Sample Project

## Setup
1. Download [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/rc/) or another IDE of your choice.
2. Download Apache Tomcat by following [these instructions](https://editrocket.com/articles/tomcat_mac.html). No need to manually start the Tomcat server as the IDE will take care of it.
3. Open NetBeans and click on the **New Project** icon. From here, select **Java with Maven** under **Categories** then **Project with Existing POM** under **Projects**. Next, click **Finish** and a new modal will open where you should point the project to the directory where you cloned this repo.
4. Add the Tomcat server in the **Services**. In this tab, right click on **Servers** and **Add Server**. Select **Apache Tomcat** then enter in the directory location where you downloaded Tomcat and a username and password for the server.

## Build and Run the application
1. Using NetBeans, click the **Clean and Build Project** icon.
2. Click the **Run Project** icon. This will start the Tomcat server and should open the application in the browser.
